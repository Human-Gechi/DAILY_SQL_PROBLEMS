# DAILY_SQL_PROBLEMS

This repository is a personal collection of SQL solutions answering business questions or random question i have written while practicing on **StrataScratch** and **HackerRank**. It serves as a log of my progress and a library of code snippets for various data engineering problems or SQL PROBLEMS.


## 📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized by the days of the week. Each folder contains .sql files for each day I tackled on that specific day:
Naming convention of .sql files -> *day-month-year.sql*

* **`MONDAY/`**: Solutions to random SQL questions.
* **`TUESDAY/`**: Solutions to random SQL questions.
* **`WEDNESDAY/`**: Solutions to random SQL questions.
* **`THURSDAY/`**: Solutions to random SQL questions.
* **`FRIDAY/`**: Solutions to random SQL questions.

* **`SUNDAY/`**: Solutions to random SQL questions.


## 📝 How to Use
Each `.sql` file follows a simple structure:
1. **Problem Description**: A comment at the top explaining the task or a link to the StrataScratch problem.
2. **SQL Query**: The solution code.
